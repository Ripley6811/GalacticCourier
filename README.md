# Galactic Courier

Test project.

**Objective**: Blast off in the spacecraft and catch up to the space station in orbit. 
Use the array of thrusters around the ship and your knowledge of physics to land 
the craft at the space station's dock.

**Tips**: 
- Look at "Diff in pos: X Y" for distance to space station. 
- The red triangle points towards the station.
- Use main thrusters to reach orbit then cut main thrusters and use smaller thrusters for minor adjustments.

Character Controls:
- Spacebar : Enter/exit a vehicle
- 8, 5, 4, 6 : Movement
